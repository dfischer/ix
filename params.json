It is stored in src/. It\r\nis a multiboot-compatible elf-format executable.\r\n\r\nRunning 'make install' on a system with sudo will rebuild the image and copy it\r\nto /boot. It assumes that you have already modified your grub configuration.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* Several files in this release were taken from or adapted from files from\r\na previous OS project, Project XANA.
