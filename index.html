<p>Ix [n]:</p>

<pre><code>1) one who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor 
why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven

2) a standalone zigzag implementation for the x86
</code></pre>

<p>The build system assumes you have a reasonably new version of gcc, qemu, nasm, 
and sudo, and a reasonably recent cdrtools. qemu and cdrtools are used only in 
'make test', so if you just want to build the kernel, you only need gcc and 
nasm. sudo is used only in 'make install', which you shouldn't do.</p>

<p>The generated kernel image is called 'ixmage.elf'. It is stored in src/. It
is a multiboot-compatible elf-format executable.</p>

<p>Running 'make install' on a system with sudo will rebuild the image and copy it
to /boot. It assumes that you have already modified your grub configuration.</p>
