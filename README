Ix [n]:
	1) one who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor 
	why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven
	
	2) a standalone zigzag implementation for the x86

The build system assumes you have a reasonably new version of gcc, qemu, nasm, 
and sudo, and that you have a loop device. qemu, sudo, and the loop device are
used only in 'make test', so if you just want to build the kernel, you only
need gcc and nasm.

The generated kernel image is called 'image.elf'. It is stored in src/. It
is a multiboot-compatible elf-format executable.

Notes:

* Several files in this release were taken from or adapted from files from
a previous OS project, Project XANA. This project was licensed under the 
GPL v.2. Some of those files were taken from its parent project, OSD
(also called OCD), by Alexander Panek. That project was under the ZLIB license.
The files from OSD have their own copyright notice. Those files that are unique
to Ix may not contain a notice.

* One file was taken from an excerpt from DJGPP, and parts of another were 
adapted from GRUB. Both projects are licensed under the GPL2. The portions so
indicated were not long enough to constitute a derivative work.

* The file multiboot.h is taken directly from GRUB, with copyright notice intact.
